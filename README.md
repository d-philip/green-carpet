# Green Carpet (Hackital 2019)

## Inspiration
Every year, many people across the country die or are severely injured because ambulances are delayed when responding to emergencies. This often occurs because the ambulances get stuck at traffic lights when responding to an emergency.

## What it Does
The web app simulates the ability for traffic lights to change proactively in favor of the ambulances response. Specifically, traffic lights along an ambulance's path would change to green a few blocks ahead of the ambulance as it approaches.

The implications for this simulation would be to help emergency services develop a device that would allow streetlights to detect ambulances using a combination of GPS, computer vision, and auditory processing to validate an ambulance's position and change the light.
